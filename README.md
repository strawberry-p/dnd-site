# dnd-site

A site for working with some DnD-related things: displaying your characters or campaign/session management. Currently WIP and frontend-only.

## Current and planned pages

[all pages are currently frontend-only]

- [Login](https://strawberry-p.github.io/dnd-site-demo/login)/[register](https://strawberry-p.github.io/dnd-site-demo/register)
- [Campaigns](https://strawberry-p.github.io/dnd-site-demo/campaigns) - list of your DnD games
- Story - page for a single DnD game, with quick info about it
- Characters - list of characters you made (since you can reuse them between games sometimes)

## Changes #1
